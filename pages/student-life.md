## Internships
As a Criminal Justice major, you can choose from numerous internship opportunities in the five county areas. We have an extensive list of sites from which to choose or you can suggest a site of special interest to you. Most sites are accepted if they give you the opportunity to come in contact with the criminal justice system or have an anti-violence component. You will do a certain number of hours of work per week at your site. It is an intensive experience of hands on education. You can view the following [pdf](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/sites/liberalarts/files/Criminal%20Justice%20Undergraduate%20Internships.pdf) to learn more about requirements, courses, placement and contacts.

## Graduate Student Association
Welcome incoming and prospective students!

Choosing the appropriate graduate program can be stressful and overwhelming. We are here to provide information in the decision-making process. If you are interested in graduate studies in the Department, how to navigate administrative paperwork, or where to live and what to do in Philly feel free to contact a graduate student. We will do whatever we can to ease your transition into graduate studies in the Department of Criminal Justice.

The Criminal Justice Graduate Student Association (CJGSA) is an active group that sponsors academic and social events that facilitate both the professional development and social development of our members. The CJGSA is responsible for serving as a liaison between graduate students and faculty members, assisting undergraduate students in the development and refinement of their coursework through the department Mentoring Center, and offering support to incoming and prospective students by sharing information and perspectives on the program, graduate student life, and living in Philadelphia. In addition to these routine activities, the CJGSA invites critical thinkers to share their justice related ideas and experiences with Temple University and Philadelphia each spring. In 2013, this event was institutionalized as the Annual John S. Goldkamp Lecture with the intention of honoring Professor Goldkamp's innovative contributions to the field of Criminal Justice.
