As a criminal justice degree student, you’ll learn the skills and knowledge needed to administer justice and affect change in the system—but you have to leave the classroom to make either happen. Temple University criminal justice students have access to exciting  [study abroad](#study-abroad-program) opportunities and [other programs](#proranger-philadelphia) that get them out into the world and exposed to real-world aspects of the criminal justice system. And students who need help financing their education can apply to a number of [scholarship and financial aid awards](#awards-and-scholarships).

## Graduate Student Association
Welcome incoming and prospective students!

Choosing the appropriate graduate program can be stressful and overwhelming. We are here to provide information in the decision-making process. If you are interested in graduate studies in the Department, how to navigate administrative paperwork, or where to live and what to do in Philly feel free to contact a graduate student. We will do whatever we can to ease your transition into graduate studies in the Department of Criminal Justice.

The Criminal Justice Graduate Student Association (CJGSA) is an active group that sponsors academic and social events that facilitate both the professional development and social development of our members. The CJGSA is responsible for serving as a liaison between graduate students and faculty members, assisting undergraduate students in the development and refinement of their coursework through the department Mentoring Center, and offering support to incoming and prospective students by sharing information and perspectives on the program, graduate student life, and living in Philadelphia. In addition to these routine activities, the CJGSA invites critical thinkers to share their justice related ideas and experiences with Temple University and Philadelphia each spring. In 2013, this event was institutionalized as the Annual John S. Goldkamp Lecture with the intention of honoring Professor Goldkamp's innovative contributions to the field of Criminal Justice.
