As a criminal justice degree student, you’ll learn the skills and knowledge needed to administer justice and affect change in the system—but you have to leave the classroom to make either happen. Temple University criminal justice students have access to exciting  [study abroad](#study-abroad-program) opportunities and [other programs](#proranger-philadelphia) that get them out into the world and exposed to real-world aspects of the criminal justice system. And students who need help financing their education can apply to a number of [scholarship and financial aid awards](#awards-and-scholarships).

## The Inside-Out Prison-Exchange Program

The program is an opportunity for everyone involved to explore issues of crime and justice behind the walls,in the hopes of deepening and transforming the dialogue about these issues.
