## Areas of Research and Projects
![Research]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized research1.png){:.img-right}
Temple’s Department of Criminal Justice consists of an eclectic body of scholars committed to deepening our understanding of crime, governance and social justice. We emphasize inter-disciplinary and multi-method inquiries that make a difference to policy and practice. We pursue cutting-edge research and innovation that draws from and extends many strands of social science, including criminology and criminal justice, geography, history, experimental psychology, social psychology, social work, sociology, and social ecology. We explore critical issues in Philadelphia and across the United States in the context of global developments and concerns.

**Our following areas of research and projects are as follows:**
- [Rehabilitation and Behavior Change](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/criminal-justice/research/rehabilitation-and-behavior-change)
Department faculty has expertise in the area of rehabilitation and behavior change pertaining to high risk and criminal behaviors that include criminal and violent offending and recidivism, delinquency, substance use and HIV risk behaviors.

- [Systems of Criminal Justice, Law, and Procedural Justice](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/criminal-justice/research/systems-of-criminal-justice-law-and-procedural-justice)
Faculty research has focused on efforts to analyze key developments and contribute to theory related to the operation of systems of criminal justice, the interlocking nature of such systems, as well as aspects of law and case processing and the strengthening of judicial processes.

- [Intersection of Public Health, Crime and Justice](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/criminal-justice/research/intersection-of-public-health-crime-and-justice)

- [Geography of Crime and Justice](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/criminal-justice/research/geography-of-crime-and-justice)
Faculty has published extensively in the area of the geography of crime and justice and has developed methodological techniques that have become widely used in the field. Faculty have examined the intersection of the location of crimes and the location of criminals, taking into account aspects of the immediate geographic area such as the street segment or block, as well as the physical and social aspects of the neighborhood.

- [Policing, Security and Crime Prevention](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/criminal-justice/research/policing-security-and-crime-prevention) 
The department has had particular strengths in research dealing with local policing, police organization, evidence-based policing and aspects of police-community relations.
- [Youth Crime, Delinquency Prevention and Juvenile Justice](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/criminal-justice/research/youth-crime-delinquency-prevention-and-juvenile-justice)
The faculty has expertise in a variety of theoretical and policy-relevant aspects of youth crime, delinquency prevention and juvenile justice.

- [Criminal Behavior and Community Crime Rates](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/criminal-justice/research/criminal-behavior-and-community-crime-rates)(traditional criminology/nature of crime, types of crime, cybercrime, terrorism)
A range of faculty has published theoretically driven works in the area of traditional criminology, and more recently in the area of cybercrime and terrorism. This is an area of critical need currently.

- [Policy Analysis and Program Evaluation](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/criminal-justice/research/policy-analysis-and-program-evaluation)
Department faculty has an active, ongoing record of involvement with public officials and justice agencies and programs locally and nationally, applying research to enhance knowledge andtheoretical understanding of policies adopted or proposed and their impact on systems. This area also includes work on organizational change and implementation science.

### Center for Security and Crime Science 
![CSCS]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized CSCS.png){:.img-right}
The [Center for Security and Crime Science](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/center-for-security-and-crime-science/index.html) (housed in the Department of Criminal Justice at Temple University) is the first center in the United States devoted to Crime Science. In the 21st Century, thinking about crime has expanded in scope to move beyond domestic concerns and security has become more broadly construed as dealing with issues of public safety and social harm. Crime is now the business of private as well as public agencies, formal as well as informal entities, all seeking to address multiple levels of security concerns.

The following list contains the centers' full projects, research and results:
- [The Philadelphia Predictive Policing Experiment](www.develop.cla.temple.edu/center-for-security-and-crime-science/projects#the-philadelphia-predictive-policing-experiment)
- [The Philadelphia Policing Tactics Experiment](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/center-for-security-and-crime-science/projects/#the-philadelphia-policing-tactics-experiment)
- [The Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/center-for-security-and-crime-science/projects#the-philadelphia-foot-patrol-experiment)
- [The Crime Reduction Impact of CCTV in Philadelphia](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/center-for-security-and-crime-science/projects#the-crime-reduction-impact-of-cctv-in-philadelphia)
- [PROVE: Predictive Policing Software](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/center-for-security-and-crime-science/projects#prove-predictive-policing-software)
