## Committed to Deepening Our Understanding of Crime, Governance and Social Justice
A Practice-Focused Intellectual Experience Students often debate issues such as police legitimacy, victims’ rights, mass incarceration, fairness in sentencing, and reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals, as well as a wide variety of other topics.
