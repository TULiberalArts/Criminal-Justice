## Committed to Deepening Our Understanding of Crime, Governance and Social Justice
A practice-focused, intellectual experience. Students often debate issues such as police legitimacy, victims’ rights, mass incarceration, fairness in sentencing, and reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals, as well as a wide variety of other topics. Criminal Justice majors make a difference by working in various criminal justice agencies, becoming attorneys and attending graduate school.
