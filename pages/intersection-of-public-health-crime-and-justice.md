## Intersection of Public Health, Crime and Justice

_Project Title_: **Juvenile Justice-Translational Research on Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System (JJ-TRIALS)** <br>
_Funding Agency_: National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health <br>
_Affiliated Faculty_: [Steven Belenko](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/belenko-steven) (PI), [Wayne Welsh](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/welsh-wayne), [Jennifer Wood](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/wood-jennifer) and [Matthew Hiller](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/hiller-matt) <br>

Description: This five-year multisite project tests implementation interventions to identify and reduce gaps in substance abuse services for adolescents under community juvenile justice supervision. The project involves a cluster randomized trial in 34 sites in 7 states. We are testing the impact of various interventions involving needs assessments, data-driven decision making, behavioral health training, and facilitated local change teams on organizational, staff, and youth outcomes.

_Project Title_: **SMART Supervision: CRIMNEEDS Evaluation** <br>
_Funding Agency_: Bureau of Justice Assistance, US Department of Justice <br>
_Affiliated Faculty_: [Steven Belenko](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/belenko-steven) (PI) and [Matthew Hiller](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/hiller-matt) <br>

Description: The goal of this project is to enhance the efforts of the Philadelphia Adult Probation and Parole Department to address the unmet needs of moderate to high-risk offenders by fully implementing the Risk-Needs-Responsivity model. Moderate and high-risk officers are being trained in case management techniques and supervision planning, a customized criminogenic needs assessment tool is being developed, and a computerized decision-making tool is being developed to identify the best services in Philadelphia to address the criminogenic needs of probationers. Temple is conducting a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of these new tools on probationer outcomes and service engagement.

_Project Title_: **Philadelphia Revived: Obtaining Success through Peer Encouraged Recovery (PROSPER)** <br>
_Funding Agency_: Laura and John Arnold Foundation <br>
_Affiliated Faculty_: [Steven Belenko](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/belenko-steven) <br>

Description: The goal of the PROSPER project, a collaboration between Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC) and Temple University’s Department of Criminal Justice, is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of integrating Peer Recovery Specialists (PRSs) in an adult drug treatment court.  A growing body of research demonstrates that peer support can facilitate recovery and reduces health care costs, but to date the model has not been tested in criminal justice settings. This study will be the first in the U.S. to assess whether PRSs, working with the Philadelphia Treatment Court (PTC) staff and treatment providers, can help to promote retention, engagement, and ongoing recovery post-graduation. During the first project phase, focus groups and interviews will be conducted with key informants to provide insight into how PRSs can best support PTC clients. During the second project phase, 112 newly enrolled PTC clients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either be connected with a PRS or to receive treatment-as-usual (56 per each condition), and monitored for 9 months. Key indicators such as relapse, re-arrest, and drug court completion will help determine whether clients assigned a PRS have greater program success than those in the control condition. This study will answer important questions regarding how to successfully integrate peer staff into drug courts, and provide preliminary indications of the efficacy of adding PRSs to the treatment court process.

_Project Title_: **CRIME-PA: Crime Model Evaluation for Physical Activity** <br>
_Funding Agency_: National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute (NIH)<br>
_Affiliated Faculty_: [Caterina Roman](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/roman-caterina) and [Ralph Taylor](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/taylor-ralph) (subcontractors to UCSD) <br>

Description: The study evaluates a trans-disciplinary conceptual model of the relation of crime and crime-related perceptions to physical activity and other cardiovascular disease-related outcomes across the life span. Research activities include development of reliable measures of crime-related constructs that will be applicable across the life span.

_Project Title_: **Using Implementation Interventions and Peer Recovery Support to Improve Opioid Treatment Outcomes in Community Supervision** <br>
_Funding Agency_: National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIH) <br>
_Affiliated Faculty_: [Steven Belenko](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/belenko-steven) and [Jennifer Wood](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/wood-jennifer)<br>

Description: In collaboration with researchers from Brown University, the University of North Carolina, and the University of Rhode Island, this project is designed to determine whether a facilitated local change team intervention, and the use of peer recovery support specialists improves access to and adherence to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) for people on probation.  This type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study involves 7 probation agencies in three states and includes (1) a core implementation study with staff trainings, agency needs assessments, and a facilitated local change team, and (2) a randomized experiment to compare MOUD treatment outcomes for probationers assigned a peer recovery support specialists and those without a peer. This project is part of NIDA’s Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network, initiated in 2019.

_Project Title_: **Enhancing Healthy Reintegration and Recovery for High-Risk Opioid Users** <br>
_Funding Agency_: Pennsylvania Department of Health<br>
_Affiliated Faculty_: [Steven Belenko](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/belenko-steven) and [Caterina Roman](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/roman-caterina)<br>

Description: This project is a quasi-experimental study of the experiences, challenges, and strategies to enhance access to medication assisted treatment (MAT) among formerly incarcerated individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) in Philadelphia. We will track outcomes for those who initiated MAT in prison or jail, and develop and implement an intervention to facilitate access to, initiation of, and adherence to MAT through the hub-and-spoke model TRUST Clinic at Temple Hospital and other community health and social services. The goals are to reduce relapse, overdose, and reincarceration, and increase engagement in treatment. Results will provide insights into the health system barriers affecting access to and long-term outcomes for MAT for previously incarcerated populations returning to Philadelphia. A minority training component will provide students from Lincoln University with opportunities to enhance their training and education in addiction, treatment, criminal justice, and public health.
