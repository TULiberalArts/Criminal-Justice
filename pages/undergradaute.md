Majoring in Criminal Justice helps to prepare students for careers as practitioners, researchers and academics in a variety of public and private sector professions in both adult and juvenile systems of justice at the federal, state and local levels of government. It also provides the core liberal arts foundations for students interested in alternative career paths or advanced education in law school and graduate programs in criminal justice, criminology and related social-science fields. Students have a wide variety of internship opportunities and our classes emphasize experiential learning. Our internationally recognized “Inside Out” program offers the opportunity to attend classes in a prison.

The mission of the Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice degree is to train students to think critically about issues related to criminal behavior, the operations of the criminal justice system and the effectiveness and fairness of society’s efforts to prevent and control it. Students are exposed to different ways of thinking about and responding to the harms associated with criminal behavior. They learn the importance of social science research and the need to inform crime policies and related social policies through rigorous research and evidence. And they acquire the skills to design and conduct research and to consume and synthesis existing scholarly knowledge.

## Highly Qualified Faculty
Our faculty members have spent years working in criminal justice and related fields and bring their research and experience into the classroom. They also have a wide variety of contacts that translate into interesting guest speakers and networking opportunities with individuals who work in all facets of criminal justice. The faculty includes many internationally recognized scholars who conduct grant-funded research on new and emerging issues of the day. Through this cutting-edge research, faculty bring fresh topics and debates to the classroom, keeping students abreast of the latest developments related to criminal justice policy and practice.

## Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice
As a liberal arts degree, the Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice trains students to think critically, to solve problems, to communicate effectively, and to conduct research designed to improve our understanding of crime and related social problems. Through the lens of criminal justice, students tackle larger issues related to effectiveness and fairness of existing policies and practices. Students learn that criminal justice is a complex system connected to other systems in society (e.g. health, education). In short, students will attain translatable skills that are relevant to many different career paths that require critical thinking, communication and knowledge building.
