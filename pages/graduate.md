## Careers
We are extremely proud of the placement record of our PhD graduates. Most go on to tenure-track academic positions, while others pursue research careers in federal, state, and local agencies or in the private sector. The secret to our success is a model of close faculty-student mentoring and professional development that begins on the first day of the program. The vast majority of our graduate students conduct grant-funded research with faculty that engages directly with community-based organizations and criminal justice agencies, working on problems such as gun violence and substance abuse.

![Police Recruit Graduation]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized police-recruit-graduation.jpg){:.img-right}
Our PhD graduates have gone on to tenure-track assistant professorships at institutions such as the University of Cincinnati, Rutgers University, Sam Houston State University, Drexel University, LaSalle University, Vancouver Island University, Towson University, and the University of Louisville; some have begun their academic careers with postdoctoral research positions at institutions like George Mason University. In addition to those embarking on academic careers, a number of our PhD graduates have secured research and policy-making positions at such varied institutions and agencies as the National Institute of Justice, Vera Institute of Justice, Research Triangle Institute, Justice Research and Statistics Association, the Police Foundation, the Center for Drug and Alcohol Studies at the University of Delaware, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania Courts, and Philadelphia Adult Probation and Parole.

A number of our Masters students are already employed in the criminal justice field. Our MA graduates include a detective in the Philadelphia Police Department and the warden of a local jail. Post-graduation, our students have secured positions in local, state, and federal law enforcement and criminal justice agencies such as the New Jersey Juvenile Justice Commission and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, while others have gone on to pursue further graduate study, here at Temple and elsewhere.

## Funding
The Department of Criminal Justice ranks among the highest in the University in faculty and student involvement in local and national research activities. The result has been a steady stream of grant-funded employment positions that provide both financial support and the opportunity to develop research skills and graduate thesis/dissertation opportunities. The doctoral program is proud of its track record of support of our doctoral students through a combination of such positions and the other sources of financial support outlined below.

Financial support is available to many Ph.D. students through a variety of University and Department teaching and research assistantships, fellowships, and awards, with the possibility of full-time employment during semester breaks and summer months. Assistantships and fellowships carry a stipend plus tuition waiver. Funding opportunities for students in the MA program students are limited.  Occasionally, there are funded research opportunities for which MA students are eligible.

The PhD is a full-time endeavor. It is our standard practice to limit admissions to the PhD program to the number of full-time students to whom we can commit funding support for a period of at least four years. Beyond the guaranteed period of support, we are extremely proud of our track record and ability to fund doctoral students who are making timely progress toward the completion of their degrees.

The Criminal Justice Graduate Student Association (CJGSA) is an active group that sponsors academic and social events that facilitate both the professional development and social development of our members. The CJGSA is responsible for serving as a liaison between graduate students and faculty members, assisting undergraduate students in the development and refinement of their coursework through the department Mentoring Center, and offering support to incoming and prospective students by sharing information and perspectives on the program, graduate student life, and living in Philadelphia. In addition to these routine activities, the CJGSA invites critical thinkers to share their justice related ideas and experiences with Temple University and Philadelphia each spring. In 2013, this event was institutionalized as the Annual John S. Goldkamp Lecture with the intention of honoring Professor Goldkamp's innovative contributions to the field of Criminal Justice.
