## Careers
A number of our Masters students are already employed in the criminal justice field. Our MA graduates include a detective in the Philadelphia Police Department and the warden of a local jail. Post-graduation, our students have secured positions in local, state, and federal law enforcement and criminal justice agencies such as the New Jersey Juvenile Justice Commission and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, while others have gone on to pursue further graduate study, here at Temple and elsewhere. We are also extremely proud of the placement record of our PhD graduates. Many go on to tenure-track academic positions, while others pursue research careers in federal, state, and local agencies or the private sector.

Many of our PhD graduates have gone on to tenure-track assistant professorships at institutions such as Drexel University, LaSalle University, University of Ottawa, Louisiana State University, Towson University, University of Louisville, and American University; some have begun their academic careers with postdoctoral research positions at institutions like George Mason University and Vera Institute of Justice. In addition to those embarking on academic careers, a number of our PhD graduates have secured research positions at such varied institutions and agencies as the National Institute of Justice, Justice Research and Statistics Association, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Center for Drug and Alcohol Studies at the University of Delaware, the Police Department of Redlands, California, and Philadelphia Adult Probation and Parole.

## Financial Opportunities (**CONTENT NEEDS TO BE TRIMMED!**)
The Department of Criminal Justice ranks among the highest in the University in faculty and student involvement in local and national research activities. The result has been a steady stream of grant-funded employment positions that provide both financial support and the opportunity to develop research skills and graduate thesis/dissertation opportunities. The doctoral program is proud of its track record of support of our doctoral students through a combination of such positions and the other sources of financial support outlined below.

Financial support is available to many graduate students through a variety of University and Department teaching and research assistantships, fellowships, and awards. Most assistantships and fellowships carry a stipend plus tuition waiver. Funding opportunities for students in the MA program students are limited. Masters students cannot be funded through Teaching Assistantships. Occasionally, there are funded research opportunities for which MA students are eligible.

The PhD is a full-time endeavor. It is our standard practice to limit admissions to the PhD program to the number of full-time students to whom we can commit funding support for a period of several years.  Beyond the guaranteed period of support, we are extremely proud of our track record and ability to fund doctoral students who are making timely progress toward the completion of their degrees.  Please note that no funding decisions can be made until after an applicant is officially admitted to the Ph.D. program. Applicants should also consult the Graduate School web pages for information on application deadlines and funding opportunities available university-wide.

Depending upon available resources, a Teaching Assistantship (TA) may be awarded either to incoming or matriculated doctoral students. If a Teaching Assistantship is awarded to an incoming student during the first year, (unless notified otherwise) the Department guarantees four years of funding from either a Teaching Assistantship position or an alternative research or support source, depending upon maintaining good academic standing. Students should be aware that good scores in the GRE examinations are one of the best predictors of availability of financial assistance.

Additional financial support is often provided by employment and training opportunities on externally funded faculty research projects. Positions on funded research projects may include full or partial tuition coverage in addition to salary for up to 20 hours per week during the semester, with the possibility of full-time employment during semester breaks and summer months. The timing and availability of such opportunities depend on the status of faculty research projects and external grants.
